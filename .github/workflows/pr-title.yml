            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! üëãüèº

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            The subject should start with an uppercase character and we support the following types:
            - `fix`
            - `feat`
            - `docs`
            - `ci`
            - `chore`
            - `revert`

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```

      # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
